##### Week 1
  Even though we were told to expect a rocky start it still felt bad that our progress was quite slow since we also had to go about learning Rails.
  Started getting better later on in the week but then ran into an issue with Heroku that we spent quite a lot of time stumped on but allowed us to better understand Heroku and understand the logs.

  Things I learnt:
  
  * Rails generate model/controller/migration
  * Setting up Travis with a database and autodeployment to Heroku
  * Setting up Heroku and looking through logs
  * AGILE process through two day sprints

##### Week 2
  Last week I ended up not using much Rails as I was mostly setting up the CI/CD pipelines so I went into this week with the aim of using more Rails. 

  Things I learnt:
  
  * Using Rails nested resources
  * Rendering partials in a view
  * Using AJAX requests with Rails forms
  * Setting up Selenium to test for Javascript
